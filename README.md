#Molecular, Cellular and Tissue Bioengineering Single Cell Symposium R Code
##Single Cell Technologies from Method Development to Application

Single cell analysis is a vital part of understanding the variability in normal and diseased biological systems. The Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Bioengineering (MCTB) faculty cluster at Arizona State University is excited to announce a symposium from experts in the single cell field and hands-on single cell RNA-seq analysis training session on April 5th, 2019.

The symposium from single cell experts will begin in the morning and finish in a networking event in the late afternoon. The symposium will cover topics including:

- Single cell technologies including RNA-seq and proteomics (CyToF)
- Application of single cell analyses to cellular differentiation
- Application to human disease with a focus on cancer
- Future directions of single cell technologies and analysis approaches

The hands-on single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis training session will continue following the symposium in the same room. The hands-on session will cover:
- From FASTQ to count matrix (10X genomics cellranger)
- Combining scRNA-seq datasets (Seurat and SCRAN)
- Seurat scRNA-seq analysis suite of tools:
- Data import, normalization, regressing out confounders, and scaling
- Clustering
- Visualization
- Building a classifier to apply to other scRNA-seq datasets
